Here's an example that maps the artistic style of The Starry Night \nonto a night-time photograph of the Stanford campus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use this example to demonstrate how Floyd can be used to deploy your trained model as a REST API endpoint that can be accessed over the web. \nThis feature is very useful if you want to quickly compare models or have others play with your models. This guide will \nwalk you through how to do this.\n\n\nSetup project\n\n\nFor this guide we will be using \nFast Style Transfer\n\nproject.\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/floydhub/fast-style-transfer\n$ cd fast-style-transfer\n$ floyd init fast-style-transfer\n\n\n\n\nTrain a model\n\n\nYou can train your model by running the \nstyle.py\n script in this repo on Floyd. You can specify any style image to use in the command line. Just \ndownload it and keep it in current path. In this example we will be starting from a \n\npre-trained model\n.\n\n\nTraining data\n\n\nThis project also requires access to the imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19 model and image training data. Floyd already has this data source available with id \n\njq4ZXUCSVer4t65rWeyieG\n. You can mount this at runtime using the \n\n--data\n paramter. For more information on how data inputs work, see \nUsing Datasets\n.\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n$ floyd run --gpu --env keras:py2 --data jq4ZXUCSVer4t65rWeyieG \npython style.py --style examples/style/la_muse.jpg --base-model-path /input/pre-trained-tf/la_muse.ckpt --epoch 1 --total-iterations 10 --checkpoint-dir /output\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will kick off a new job on Floyd. This will take a few minutes to run and will generate the model. You can follow along the progress \nby using the \nlogs\n command. \n\n\n$ floyd logs \nRUN_ID\n -t\n\n\n\n\nNow you need to get the ID of the \nOutput\n generated by your job. Floyd \ninfo\n can give you that information.\n\n\n$ floyd info \nRUN_ID\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate your model\n\n\nYou can evaluate the generated model by running \nevaluate.py\n on sample images. Use the output id from the training step\nas the datasource in this step. Add any image you want to style transfer to the \nimages\n directory. Then run \nevaluate.py\n.\n\n\nfloyd run --env keras:py2 --data \nREPLACE_WITH_OUTPUT_ID\n \npython evaluate.py --allow-different-dimensions  --checkpoint /input/fns.ckpt --in-path ./images/ --out-path /output/\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can track the status of the run with the status or logs command.\n\n\n$ floyd status \nRUN_ID\n\n$ floyd logs \nRUN_ID\n -t\n\n\n\n\nAfter the job finishes successfuly, view the output directory to see the style transfered images. Run the floyd \noutput\n\nfor this.\n\n\n$ floyd output \nRUN_ID\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving the model\n\n\nYou may notice that the output does not look great. That is because we ran the training for a small number of iterations. To train \na fully working model try the train step again, this time without setting \n--total-iterations\n and increasing the \n--epoch\n to 2.\nIt takes about 8 hours to train a model that works well.

IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS WHO ACCESS OUR SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS \"YOU\" OR \"YOUR\" SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND USERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.\n\n\nIf Floydhub makes material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email and/or by posting a notice on our site before the changes are effective. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time on the Site.\n\n\nViolation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While Floydhub prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that Floydhub cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.\n\n\nA. Account Terms\n\n\n\n\nYou must be 13 years or older to use this Service.\n\n\nYou must be a human. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted.\n\n\nYou must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.\n\n\nYour login may only be used by one person - a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as your plan allows.\n\n\nYou are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Floydhub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.\n\n\nYou are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when Content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).\n\n\nOne person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.\n\n\nYou may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).\n\n\nYou may not use this Service if you are a direct competitor, except with Floydhub's prior written consent. You may not use or access the Service to compile data in a manner that is used or usable by a competitive product or service.\n\n\n\n\nB. Use Terms\n\n\nYou expressly understand and agree that Floydhub shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Floydhub has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the Services.\n\n\nAbuse or excessively frequent requests to Floydhub may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access. Floydhub, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage. Floydhub will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.\n\n\nFloydhub reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access with or without notice.\n\n\nC. Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms\n\n\n\n\nYou are not required to provide a credit card number to open an account.\n\n\nOnce your free trial period has ended you will be required to enter a credit card to continue usage.\n\n\nAny usage once you enter credit card information will immediately incur a usage charge.\n\n\nFloydhub calculates your server usage in seconds and bills you for that amount of usage at the prevailing rates displayed on our web site. We track your usage in seconds and charge you for the fraction of an hour that you used. So if you only use 5 minutes, you'll only be billed for 5 minutes. Please note that we will round each charge up to the nearest cent (so the minimum charge is 1 cent).\n\n\nRoughly once a month, we will bill you for the usage charges you have accrued over the preceding month (unless other payment terms have been arranged).\n\n\nAll fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.\n\n\nDowngrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Floydhub does not accept any liability for such loss.\n\n\n\n\nD. Cancellation and Termination\n\n\nYou are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Contact support@floydhub.com for canceling your account.\n\n\nFloydhub, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other Floydhub service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. Floydhub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time\n\n\nE. Modification of the Services\n\n\nFloydhub reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.\n\n\nPrices of all Services, including but not limited to monthly subscription plan fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30 days notice from us (unless you have agreed otherwise with Floydhub). Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the Floydhub Site (Floydhub.com) or the Service itself.\n\n\nFloydhub shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.\n\n\nF. Copyright and Content Ownership\n\n\nWe claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service. Your profile and materials uploaded remain yours. However, if you set your pages to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view your Content.\n\n\nFloydhub does not pre-screen Content, but Floydhub and its designee have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or remove any Content that is available via the Service.\n\n\nYou shall defend Floydhub against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Floydhub by a third party alleging that Your Content, or Your use of the Service in violation of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party or violates applicable law, and shall indemnify Floydhub for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by, Floydhub in connection with any such claim, demand, suit or proceeding; provided, that Floydhub (a) promptly gives You written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (b) gives You sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that You may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases Floydhub of all liability); and (c) provides to You all reasonable assistance, at Your expense.\n\n\nThe look and feel of the Service is copyright \u00a92017 Floyd Labs, Inc.

So you need to use the shell menu to paste the token. After copying the \ntoken right click on the top bar of the command shell and select Paste. See image below:\n\n\n\n\nRunning Experiments\n\n\nWhy does \nfloyd status\n return an empty list even though I have several runs in my account?\n\n\nFloyd CLI uses the project directory to store the run information (similar to git). So you need \nto be in the directory where you initialized the project and you should be able to see all your \nruns. You can also use the \nweb dashboard\n to view all your \nprojects in one place.\n\n\nWhat do I do when I get \"What do you do when you get \u201cYou are over the allowed limits for this operation. Consider upgrading your account\u201d?\n\n\nFloydhub currently allows only 5 active runs per user. If you require more concurrency, contact \nus from the \npricing\n page.\n\n\nI get \"Too many open files\" error when I run my project.\n\n\nFloyd CLI throws this error when you have too many files in your current directory that needs to be uploaded. \nThe actual limit depends on your OS / machine specs.\n\n\nYou can either:\n\n\n\n\nRemove unnecessary files from the directory (like build directory, docs etc.) \n\n\nAdd them to \n.floydignore\n file. Floyd CLI will just ignore these directories. \nSee the \nfloydignore\n documentation to understand how this can be configured.\n\n\nTar them into a single file and untar them at runtime.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, instead of uploading files from your local machine, you can also \n\ndownload files\n from a remote URL \ndirectly into Floyd servers.\n\n\nI ran my project in Jupyter mode but the url does not seem to work.\n\n\nJupyter notebook server takes a couple of minutes to start. Until then you will get a \"Bad Gateway\" \nor similar error when you access the URL. You can check the status of the Jupyter notebook \nby running the \nlogs\n command.\n\n\nAm I using the GPU instance by default?\n\n\nJobs are run on CPU instances by default. You can specify \n--gpu\n to run them on GPU instances.\n\n\nMy job is taking a while to \"sync changes\". How do I make it go faster?\n\n\nFloyd CLI uploads \nall\n the files in your current directory before starting your experiment.\nThere are a few ways to make this go faster:\n\n\n\n\nRemove unnecessary files from the directory (like build directory, docs etc.) \n\n\nAdd sub-directories to \n.floydignore\n file. Floyd CLI will ignore and not upload these sub-directories.\nSee the \ninit\n command to understand how this can be configured.\n\n\nIf you have large data files consider uploading them separately as a \ndata source\n. \nYou can then \nrefer\n to them in your project.\n\n\n\n\nMy job finished but how I do I see my output?\n\n\nYou can use the floyd \noutput\n command to view the output of your \nproject. If you want to use this output in your next run view \nthis guide\n\n\nDo I have to pay for the entire time my Jupyter Notebook is running?\n\n\nUnfortunately, yes. As much as we would like to, we are unable to charge you only for the \ncomputation time\n. \n\n\nThis is an engineering challenge. When you start a Jupyter Notebook instance and start executing commands, \nyour state is maintained in memory (both CPU and GPU memory). So the instance has to be alive for the \nentire duration of your notebook, not just when you are executing commands.\n\n\nFor example, when you execute \nimport tensorflow\n \ncommand, Tensorflow will allocate the entire GPU memory to the current session and waits for the next command. This makes the instance unusable by anyone else, so we have to charge you for the duration your Notebook is alive.\n\n\nBilling\n\n\nWhat payment types do you accept?\n\n\nCurrently, we accept credit or debit cards, including Visa, MasterCard and American Express.\n\n\nDo you keep my credit card information?\n\n\nNo, we do not retain any credit card information. We use \nStripe\n to \nprocess payments.\n\n\nWhen will my credit card be charged?\n\n\nYou can see your billing due date in the \nUsage\n tab on your Floydhub dashboard.",
