We will train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten digits using Tensorflow and the MNIST dataset. For more details on the data and the model, please refer to the \nTensorflow tutorial\n.\n\n\nWhat we will accomplish in this guide\n\n\n\n\nLearn about FloydHub's web dashboard and \nfloyd-cli\n tool\n\n\nInitialize an existing project on your computer\n\n\nRun a job using \nfloyd run\n command to train your deep learning model on FloydHub's GPU servers\n\n\nView the logs and stored output\n\n\n\n\nQuick preparation checklist\n\n\n\n\nYou must have a \nFloydHub account\n\n\nYou must have \nfloyd-cli\n \ninstalled on your computer\n\n\nYou must \nlog in to FloydHub through the CLI\n\n\n\n\nWeb dashboard and floyd-cli\n\n\nFloydHub has a \nweb dashboard\n and a \nCLI\n that you can use to interact with FloydHub from your terminal. If you are familiar with Github, think of the CLI tool (\nfloyd\n command) as the equivalent of the \ngit\n command. You can initialize projects, run jobs, view logs and outputs, etc. all using the CLI. \n\n\nThe web dashboard is useful for getting an overview of your work and exploring others' projects and datasets.\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nGet the code\n\n\nWe will clone the \nquick-start repository\n from Github and run it on FloydHub. \n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/floydhub/quick-start.git\nCloning into 'quick-start'...\n...\n$ cd quick-start\n\n\n\n\n$ ls\nLICENSE    mnist_cnn.py    mnist_cnn.ipynb    README.md\n\n\n\n\nThis repository contains two main files: \nmnist_cnn.py\n (a Python script) and \nmnist_cnn.ipynb\n (a Jupyter Notebook). In this guide, we will use the Python script. We will explore running Jupyter Notebooks in our \nnext tutorial\n.\n\n\nInitialize project\n\n\nIf you are a new user, you should see a default project named \nquick-start\n in your \nProjects dashboard\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't see it, you can create a new project named \nquick-start\n and still follow through with the rest of this guide. See \ninstructions\n to create a new project.\n\n\nA Project is a space for tackling a specific problem. It is a collection of jobs that you run, data, logs and results. If you have used GitHub, projects in FloydHub are a lot like code repositories.\n\n\nTo start using this project, initialize it in your current directory in your terminal. \n\n\n$ floyd init quick-start\nProject \"quick-start\" initialized in the current directory\n\n\n\n\nThis tells Floyd that all the jobs you run from this directory belong to the project named \nquick-start\n.\n\n\nRunning your first job on FloydHub\n\n\nA Job is created when you execute a command inside a project on FloydHub.\n\n\nRunning a job on FloydHub is simple. It is very similar to running code on your local machine. Instead, when you use the \nfloyd run\n command, the CLI syncs your code to the FloydHub's servers and runs it in the cloud. \n\n\nFor this tutorial, we will run the \nmnist_cnn.py\n Python script on FloydHub's GPU servers.\n\n\n$ floyd run --gpu --env tensorflow \"python mnist_cnn.py\"\nSyncing code ...\nRUN ID                  NAME               \n----------------------  -------------------\nAKpnXqj9BEU6d8KhmygTyb  alice/quick-start/1\n\nTo view the logs enter:\n    floyd logs alice/quick-start/1\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! Your first job is now running on FloydHub's GPU. Behind the scenes, Floyd does the following:\n\n\n\n\nSync your local code to FloydHub's server\n\n\nProvision a GPU instance on the cloud (because \n--gpu\n)\n\n\nSet up a deep learning environment with GPU drivers and Tensorflow installed (because \n--env tensorflow\n)\n\n\nExecute the command \npython mnist_cnn.py\n inside this environment\n\n\nStore the output logs and generated output data\n\n\nTerminate the GPU instance once the command finishes execution\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\nCheck the status of your job\n\n\nYou can view the status of your job from your terminal using the \nfloyd status\n command. You can specify a single job name (e.g. \nfloyd status alice/quick-start/1\n) to get its status, or the CLI will show the status of all jobs in the current project.\n\n\n$ floyd status\nRUN ID                  CREATED        STATUS    DURATION(s)  NAME                 INSTANCE    DESCRIPTION\n----------------------  ---------      --------  -----------  -------------------  ---------   -----------\nAKpnXqj9BEU6d8KhmygTyb  just now       running            15  alice/quick-start:1  gpu         \n\n\n\n\nYou can also view the status of your job in your browser by visiting the \nJob URL\n printed by the \nfloyd run\n command. For example, \nwww.floydhub.com/alice/quick-start/1\n\n\n\n\nView output logs\n\n\nYou can view the logs generated by the job from your terminal using the \nfloyd logs\n command. You need to specify the job name.\n\n\n$ floyd logs -t alice/quick-start/1\n...\n2017-07-12 16:00:07,446 INFO - Starting attempt 1 at 2017-07-12 16:00:07.436349\n2017-07-12 16:00:09,088 INFO - Starting container...\n2017-07-12 16:00:09,297 INFO - \n...\n##############################################################################\n2017-07-12 16:00:09,297 INFO - Run Output:\n2017-07-12 16:01:46,154 INFO - Successfully downloaded train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz 9912422 bytes.\n2017-07-12 16:01:46,158 INFO - Iter 1280, Minibatch Loss= 39855.289062, Training Accuracy= 0.17969\n2017-07-12 16:01:46,159 INFO - Iter 2560, Minibatch Loss= 14964.132812, Training Accuracy= 0.42969\n...\n##############################################################################\n...\n\n\n\n\nThe output of your code is printed in the \nRun Output\n section of the logs, in between the printed \n#########\n lines.

Here's an example that maps the artistic style of The Starry Night \nonto a night-time photograph of the Stanford campus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use this example to demonstrate how Floyd can be used to deploy your trained model as a REST API endpoint that can be accessed over the web. \nThis feature is very useful if you want to quickly compare models or have others play with your models. This guide will \nwalk you through how to do this.\n\n\nSetup project\n\n\nFor this guide we will be using \nFast Style Transfer\n\nproject.\n\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/floydhub/fast-style-transfer\n$ cd fast-style-transfer\n$ floyd init fast-style-transfer\nProject \"fast-style-transfer\" initialized in the current directory\n\n\n\n\nTrain a model\n\n\nYou can train your model by running the \nstyle.py\n script in this repo on Floyd. You can specify any style image to use in the command line. Just \ndownload it and keep it in current path. In this example we will be starting from a \n\npre-trained model\n.\n\n\nTraining data\n\n\nThis project also requires access to the imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19 model and image training data. Floyd already has this data source available.\nYou can mount this at runtime using the \n--data\n parameter.\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n$ floyd run --gpu --env tensorflow-0.12:py2 --data narenst/datasets/coco-train-2014/1:images --data narenst/datasets/neural-style-transfer-pre-trained-models/1:models --data narenst/datasets/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-16/1:vgg \"python style.py --vgg-path /vgg/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-16.mat --train-path /images/train2014 --style examples/style/la_muse.jpg --base-model-path /models/la_muse.ckpt --epoch 1 --total-iterations 10 --checkpoint-dir /output\"\n\n\n\n\nThis will kick off a new job on Floyd. This will take a few minutes to run and will generate the model. You can follow along the progress \nby using the \nlogs\n command. \n\n\n$ floyd logs <RUN_NAME> -t\n\n\n\n\nNow you need to get the ID of the \nOutput\n generated by your job. Floyd \ninfo\n can give you that information.\n\n\n$ floyd info <RUN_NAME>\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate your model\n\n\nYou can evaluate the generated model by running \nevaluate.py\n on sample images. Use the output id from the training step\nas the datasource in this step. Add any image you want to style transfer to the \nimages\n directory. Then run \nevaluate.py\n.\n\n\nfloyd run --env tensorflow-0.12:py2 --data <REPLACE_WITH_OUTPUT_ID>:input \"python evaluate.py --allow-different-dimensions  --checkpoint /input/fns.ckpt --in-path ./images/ --out-path /output/\"\n\n\n\n\nYou can track the status of the run with the status or logs command.\n\n\n$ floyd status <RUN_NAME>\n$ floyd logs <RUN_NAME> -t\n\n\n\n\nAfter the job finishes successfully, view the output directory to see the style transferred images. Run the floyd \noutput\n\nfor this.\n\n\n$ floyd output <RUN_NAME>\n\n\n\n\nImproving the model\n\n\nYou may notice that the output does not look great. That is because we ran the training for a small number of iterations. To train \na fully working model try the train step again, this time without setting \n--total-iterations\n and increasing the \n--epoch\n to 2.\nIt takes about 8 hours to train a model that works well. You can instead try one of our pre-trained models in the next section.\n\n\nEvaluate pre-trained models\n\n\nIf you want to try out some awesome pre-trained models for various styles, you can use the datasource with models available publicly.\nYou can play with any of these model and style transfer any image you prefer. Just add them to \nimages\n directory. And point to the \nright model in the \n--checkpoint\n parameter.\n\n\nfloyd run --env tensorflow-0.12:py2 --data narenst/datasets/neural-style-transfer-pre-trained-models/1:models \"python evaluate.py --allow-different-dimensions  --checkpoint /models/la_muse.ckpt --in-path ./images/ --out-path /output/\"\n\n\n\n\nYou can track the status of the run with the status command.\n\n\n$ floyd status <RUN_NAME>\n\n\n\n\nWhen the experiment is finished, you can see the style transferred images by running:\n\n\n$ floyd output <RUN_NAME>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel API\n\n\nYou can now host this model as a REST API. This means you can send any image to this API as a HTTP request and it will be style transferred. \n\n\nServe mode\n\n\nFloyd \nrun\n command has a \nserve\n mode. This will upload the files in the current directory and run a special command - \n\npython app.py\n. Floyd expects this file to contain the code to run a web server and listen on port \n5000\n. You can see the \n\napp.py\n file in the sample repository. This file handles the \nincoming request, executes the code in \nevaluate.py\n and returns the output.\n\n\nNote that this feature is in preview mode and is not production ready yet\n\n\n$ floyd run --env tensorflow-0.12:py2 --data narenst/datasets/neural-style-transfer-pre-trained-models/1:input --mode serve\nSyncing code ...\nRUN ID                  NAME                              VERSION\n----------------------  ------------------------------  ---------\nDJSdJAVa3u7AsFEMZMBBL5  floydhub/fast-style-transfer:5          5\n\nPath to service endpoint: https://www.floydhub.com/expose/t4AdkU6awahkT3ooNazw8c\n\nTo view logs enter:\n    floyd logs DJSdJAVa3u7AsFEMZMBBL5\n\n\n\n\nSending requests to the REST API\n\n\nNow you can send any image file as request to this api and it will return the style transferred image.\n\n\ncurl -o taipei_output.jpg -F \"file=@./images/taipei101.jpg\" https://www.floydhub.com/expose/t4AdkU6awahkT3ooNazw8c\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see the default style (\nla_muse\n) is applied to the input image.\n\n\nTrying out different models\n\n\nYou can also pass in the name of the checkpoint to use and the image will be style transferred accordingly:\n\n\ncurl -o taipei_udnie.jpg -F \"file=@./images/taipei101.jpg\" -F \"checkpoint=udnie.ckpt\"  https://www.floydhub.com/expose/MUDFXViCLArG2drppvU3nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis uses a different style checkpoint to render the image.

Floyd CLI will just ignore these directories.\nSee the \nfloydignore\n documentation to understand how this can be configured.\n\n\nTar them into a single file and untar them at runtime.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, instead of uploading files from your local machine, you can also\n\ndownload files\n from a remote URL\ndirectly into Floyd servers.\n\n\nI ran my project in Jupyter mode but the url does not seem to work.\n\n\nJupyter notebook server takes a couple of minutes to start. Until then you will get a \"Bad Gateway\"\nor similar error when you access the URL. You can check the status of the Jupyter notebook\nby running the \nlogs\n command.\n\n\nAm I using the GPU instance by default?\n\n\nJobs are run on CPU instances by default. You can specify \n--gpu\n to run them on GPU instances.\n\n\nMy job is taking a while to \"sync changes\". How do I make it go faster?\n\n\nFloyd CLI uploads \nall\n the files in your current directory before starting your experiment.\nThere are a few ways to make this go faster:\n\n\n\n\nRemove unnecessary files from the directory (like build directory, docs etc.)\n\n\nAdd sub-directories to \n.floydignore\n file. Floyd CLI will ignore and not upload these sub-directories.\nSee the \ninit\n command and \nignore files guide\n to understand how this can be configured.\n\n\nIf you have large data files consider uploading them separately as a \ndata source\n.\nYou can then \nrefer\n to them in your project.\n\n\n\n\nMy job finished but how I do I see my output?\n\n\nYou can use the floyd \noutput\n command to view the output of your\nproject. If you want to use this output in your next run view \nthis guide\n.\n\n\nDo I have to pay for the entire time my Jupyter Notebook is running?\n\n\nUnfortunately, yes. As much as we would like to, we are unable to charge you only for the \ncomputation time\n.\n\n\nThis is an engineering challenge. When you start a Jupyter Notebook instance and start executing commands,\nyour state is maintained in memory (both CPU and GPU memory). So the instance has to be alive for the\nentire duration of your notebook, not just when you are executing commands.\n\n\nFor example, when you execute \nimport tensorflow\n\ncommand, Tensorflow will allocate the entire GPU memory to the current session and waits for the next command. This makes the instance unusable by anyone else, so we have to charge you for the duration your Notebook is alive.\n\n\nWhy was my CPU job Killed without warning?\n\n\nOccasionally, you may notice that your CPU job died without warning. The output logs just display \nKilled\n. For example,\n\n\n################################################################################\n\n2017-07-24 03:33:42,530 INFO - Run Output:\n...\n2017-07-24 03:33:52,920 INFO - Using TensorFlow backend.\n2017-07-24 03:34:04,381 INFO - >> loading UNet of size 1152x256...\n2017-07-24 03:34:10,942 INFO - Epoch 1/100\n2017-07-24 03:35:17,221 INFO - Killed\n2017-07-24 03:35:18,680 INFO - \n################################################################################\n\n\n\n\nThis happens when your machine runs out of memory (OOM). i.e. your job consumes more memory than is available on our CPU machines.\n\n\nAll jobs run on FloydHub are executed inside a Docker container. Our current CPU machines have \n7GB memory\n. When memory used by your job exceeds 7GB, Docker automatically kills the job to protect the system and avoid abuse.\n\n\nThe resolution is to optimize your code to consume less memory. For example, read less data into your in-memory datastructures or reduce your batch size. We will be introducing more powerful CPUs, which higher memory in the near future.\n\n\n\n\nHelp make this document better\n\n\nThis guide, as well as the rest of our docs, are open-source and available on \n\nGitHub\n.
