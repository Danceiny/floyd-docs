Please note that we will round each charge up to the nearest cent (so the minimum charge is 1 cent).</li>
<li>Roughly once a month, we will bill you for the usage charges you have accrued over the preceding month (unless other payment terms have been arranged).</li>
<li>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.</li>
